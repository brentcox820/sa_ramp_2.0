Session Activities and Homework for the SA Ramp 2.0 Enablement by Brent Cox 

Welcome to RAMP 2.0 
- We will be using this GIT REPO for all activities and session reviews to not only allow us to work in GIT for practice but also have a way to keep all the discussions and topics in one location.

Please follow this GIT and Review the ISSUES as they are the resources for each session.
